<h1>Official Monster Raving Loony Party</h1>
<h3>
    The Official Monster Raving Loony Party is a political party established in the United Kingdom <br>
    in 1983 by the musician David Sutch, also known as "Screaming Lord Sutch, 3rd Earl of Harrow", <br>
    or simply "Lord Sutch".[3] It is notable for its deliberately bizarre policies and <br>
    it effectively exists to satirise British politics, and to offer itself as an alternative <br>
    for protest voters, especially in constituencies where the party holding a safe seat is <br>
    unlikely to lose it.
</h3>

<p>
    The OMRLP are distinguished by having a deliberately bizarre manifesto, which contains things <br>
    that seem to be impossible or too absurd to implement – usually to highlight what they <br>
    see as real-life absurdities. Despite its satirical nature, some of the things that have featured <br>
    in Loony manifestos have become law, such as "passports for pets", abolition of dog licences and <br>
    all-day pub openings.<br>

    Other suggestions so far unadopted included minting a 99p coin and forbidding greyhound racing <br>
    in order to "stop the country going to the dogs".<br>

    The Loonies generally field as many candidates as possible in United Kingdom general elections, <br>
    some (but by no means all) standing under ridiculous names they have adopted via deed poll. <br>
    Sutch himself stood against all three main party leaders (John Major, Neil Kinnock and Paddy Ashdown) <br>
    in the 1992 general election. Parliamentary candidates have to pay their own deposit <br>
    (which currently stands at £500) and cover all of their expenses. <br>
    No OMRLP candidate has managed to get the required 5% of the popular vote needed to retain their deposit, <br>
    but this does not stop people standing. Sutch came closest with 4.1% and over a thousand votes <br>
    at the Rotherham by-election, whilst Stuart Hughes still holds the record for the largest number of votes <br>
    for a Loony candidate at a Parliamentary election, with 1,442 at the 1992 general election in <br>
    the Honiton seat in east Devon. The all-time highest vote achieved was by comedian Danny Bamford aka <br>
    Danny Blue, who secured 3,339 votes in the 1994 European elections under the pseudonym of "John Major".<br>
    Bamford had also acted as an election agent for Lindi St Clair's rival Corrective Party, and was <br>
    a former close associate of Stuart Hughes.<br>

    In the run-up to the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum, the party adopted an equivocal stance, <br>
    advising its supporters, on 8 April, to "vote as you see fit".[26] In response to mainstream parties <br>
    debating Brexit, the OMRLP suggested sending Noel Edmonds to the European Parliament <br>
    "because he understands Deal or No Deal".<br>
